My recomendation:

DON'T edit stuff in rootfs. This is 
where the file system for the OS.


=========
Blocks - Folder where most of the blocks for this
filesystem will probably be. This isn't a 
guarntee, though.

inode - Contains the inode and other data about
the filesytem

Readme - Read it all the way through and follow all
instructions, right now.
